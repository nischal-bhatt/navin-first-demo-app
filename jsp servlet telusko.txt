how does servlet works 

client and a server machine 
client sends a request to server, expecting a page 
page can be static or dynamic --> static it means it is already made
dynamic means it will be built at runtime 

client sends request to server
server has a file --> that file goes to client (request response done)


but now lets say u r asking for a page that will be built at runtime
client sends request to server, but server says hold on i dun have any page (server only has index.html for now)
so u have to build that page
request goes to a helper application (web container)
in this web container, u will have servlet --> 


servlet is basically a java file that can take requests from the client

and it can process that request and it can provide u a response in the form of an html page



servlet will process ur request (fetch the values) --> and it will send the html page
client's request if it is dynamic it will go to web container (tomcat) 



dynamic request goes to tomcat --> now tomcat says ive got a request, but that request
is for abc.htm .. and we dont have that page.. we have to build it..
that request goes to servlet (servlet will be a java class) 

inside ur container --> u have a special file called deployment descriptor in which 
u mention for which request which servlet should be called 
each request will be mapped to a servlet 
deployment descriptor (web.xml) 

a servlet is a normal class which extends httpservlet (it will provide all the features u need)


response will be in html format 


we can use annotations on servlet --> to replace web.xml
